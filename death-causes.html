            <p>
                Understanding the leading causes of death and diseases is crucial in assessing the health status of populations and identifying
                areas for improvement. The link between death causes, diseases, and life expectancy is a complex and multifaceted topic that
                requires careful analysis and interpretation of data. By examining trends and patterns in death causes and diseases across
                different regions and time periods, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence health outcomes and help
                inform public health policies and interventions.

            <p>
                This stacked percentage area chart provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of communicable, noncommunicable, and injuries
                causes of death across different continents over time. The chart highlights that noncommunicable causes of death are the most
                frequent across all continents, which is consistent with global trends. However, there are some notable differences in the
                distribution of communicable and injuries causes of death between continents.
            </p>

            <p>
                In particular, Africa stands out as having a significantly higher percentage of communicable causes of death compared to other
                continents. This is likely due to a range of factors such as limited access to healthcare, poor sanitation and hygiene, and
                exposure to infectious diseases. However, the chart also shows that this percentage is decreasing over time, which suggests that
                efforts to combat communicable diseases in Africa are yielding positive results. This is a promising trend that highlights the
                importance of continued investment in healthcare infrastructure and disease prevention programs in Africa.
            </p>

            <p>
                Injuries causes of death, on the other hand, have a similar level of distribution across all continents over time. This highlights
                the need for continued efforts to address issues such as road safety, workplace safety, and violence prevention, which are major
                contributors to injuries causes of death globally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, this stacked percentage area chart provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of causes of death across
                different continents over time. The chart can be used to inform policies and programs aimed at improving health outcomes and
                reducing mortality rates worldwide.
