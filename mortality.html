            <h2>Understanding Mortality: <br><span>A key indicator of public health</span></h2>
            
            <p>
                Mortality is a critical indicator of public health, measuring the number of deaths in a population over a specific period.
                Mortality rates can vary widely based on age, sex, and underlying health conditions, as well as broader social and economic
                factors like access to healthcare, education, and environmental conditions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Visualizing mortality data through graphs and charts can help us to better understand patterns and trends in the data,
                such as variations in mortality rates between different demographic groups or changes in mortality rates over time.
                By analyzing mortality data, public health officials can identify risk factors for specific health conditions and develop
                targeted interventions to reduce mortality rates and improve population health.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, mortality data is a critical tool for assessing the health of populations and guiding public health policy and
                interventions.

                The boxplot of mortality rates across continents offers a clear and concise way to visualize changes in mortality over time.
                One striking observation is the general decrease in mortality rates across all continents, reflecting progress made in public
                health interventions and healthcare access globally. Additionally, there is a notable decrease in the variability of mortality
                rates within each continent, indicating how an attempt has been made to make the health conditions of the various countries of
                the continents more and more equitable.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is also worth noting the decline in mortality rates in Africa and Asia over the years, which can be attributed to various
                interventions and improvements in healthcare access. Conversely, Europe shows an increase in mortality rates around 2019, which
                could be linked to a variety of factors, such as an aging population, changes in healthcare systems, or the impact of specific
                health conditions. Further analysis is necessary to identify the specific drivers of these trends and inform targeted interventions
                to address them. Overall, the boxplot effectively communicates complex mortality data and highlights important variations in mortality
                trends across different regions and time periods.

            <p>
                The mortality rate by age group in each continent over time is an important indicator of the health of populations.
                Looking at this grouped barplot, we can see that at the beginning of the time period, the mortality rate of all age groups is somehow
                high with respect to the situation in our times. In particular, the mortality rate for children in age group 0-9 was higher in Africa,
                Asia, Latin America, and Oceania compared to other age groups and continents.
                However, as time goes on, we can see a significant decrease in mortality rates across all age groups and continents.
                This decrease can be attributed to advances in medical technology, access to healthcare, and public health initiatives.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's interesting to note that while the mortality rates for all age groups decreased, the age groups of 80-89 and 90+ show
                an increase.
                This is a symptom of an increasing value of life expectancy, indicating that people are living longer and dying for natural causes.
                This is a positive trend and reflects improvements in healthcare and quality of life.
                The increase of mortality rate in age group 70-79 iEurope and Northern America can suggest that people in developed continents are more
                likely to live longer, as said before, but are also more likely to experience age-related health issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, this grouped barplot highlights the progress that has been made in improving global health outcomes.
                However, there are still significant disparities in mortality rates between continents: despite the general trend of decreasing mortality
                rates, it is still concerning to see that the mortality rate in the 0-9 age group in Africa remains higher than in other continents.
                This highlights the importance of continued efforts to improve healthcare access and disease prevention in Africa.
